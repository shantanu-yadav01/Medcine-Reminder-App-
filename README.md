### Need of Project :
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Health is the only thing that we should care the most. COVID-19 made all the people aware about the importance of health. In such a situation, forgetting about the medicine timings can severely affect the health of an individual. Taking this into consideration, I came up with the idea of this project. The main feature of this project is that it is `multi-user`. so that all the family members especially the elder people who generally dont have smartphones can get benefitted by saving their schedule in one of the smartphone in their family.
